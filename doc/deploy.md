# Deployment

SkyPortal can be deployed either with or without using Docker.
Without Docker, all services (such as the database) need to be running
locally, as described in [setup](setup).

More commonly, production deployment will use Docker images. Here, we
discuss how to deploy via
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), but much of the
same information applies when using Kubernetes, for which we have an
[example deployment](https://github.com/skyportal/deploy).

## Building the Docker images

The first step is to obtain the images to launch. We deploy
[SkyPortal images](https://hub.docker.com/r/skyportal/web) to Docker
Hub from time to time, which you can fetch using:

```
docker pull skyportal/web
```

Otherwise, you may build the images from scratch:

```
make docker-local
```

## Starting containers

Next, we deploy two containers: `web` (the SkyPortal application) and
`db` (the PostgreSQL server). The database is stored and persisted in a local
docker volume called `skyportal_dbdata` (see `docker volume ls`).

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Once both services are up and running, you may browse to SkyPortal at `http://localhost:9000`.

## Handling problems

You can see which containers are running with `docker-compose ps`.

Inspect the logs for the running containers using:

```
docker-compose logs web
docker-compose logs db
```

(Or, follow the logs with `docker-compose logs -f db`.)

## Adding test data

Note that by default, the SkyPortal image will run the application in production (`make run_production`).

The key behavior to note when running production mode is that the application will not create any database tables automatically (to avoid messing with production data). This means that the very first time you spin up SkyPortal using containers, the `skyportal_dbdata` volume will only have an empty database. You will need to set up the database tables manually. The easiest way to do this would be to run:

```
docker exec skyportal-web-1 bash -c 'source /skyportal_env/bin/activate && FLAGS="--create_tables --config=config.yaml" make load_demo_data'
```

*Note: Older versions of docker compose may use a different container name, such as `skyportal_web_1` (with underscores instead of dashes).*

This will also load in some test data to play with.

## Stopping the deployment

You may stop both containers using:

```
docker-compose stop
```

Or stop and remove them using:

```
docker-compose down
```

This does not affect data, which lives in the `./dbdata` directory.
