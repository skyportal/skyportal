# Setup


## Dependencies

SkyPortal requires the following software to be installed.  We show
how to install them on MacOS and Debian-based systems below.

- Python 3.10 or later (<3.13, since `numba` requires <3.13)
- Supervisor (v>=4.2.1)
- NGINX (v>=1.7)
- PostgreSQL (v>=14.0)
- Bun (v>=1.1.33)

When installing SkyPortal on Debian-based systems, 2 additional packages are required to be able to install `pycurl` later on:

- libcurl4-gnutls-dev
- libgnutls28-dev

## Environment Setup
SkyPortal is a full-stack application with a Python backend and JavaScript frontend. You'll need to set up both environments.

### Backend Environment (Python)
We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package management and virtual environment creation. It's a faster alternative to pip and virtualenv.
To install uv, run
```angular2html
# macOS/ Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Frontend Environment (JavaScript)
For the frontend, we use [bun](https://bun.sh/docs), an all-in-one JavaScript toolkit that provides a fast JavaScript runtime (which replaces Node.js),
a package manager (which replaces npm), and up to 4x faster startup times than Node.js. To install Bun, run
```angular2html
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```
### Reload Shell
Make sure to reload your shell or open a new terminal to access uv and bun. You can also verify the install by running `bun --version` and `uv -version`.

## Cloning SkyPortal and Configuring the Python Environment

Clone the [SkyPortal repository](https://github.com/skyportal/skyportal) and start a new
virtual environment.

```
git clone https://github.com/skyportal/skyportal.git
cd skyportal/
uv venv skyportal_env
source skyportal_env/bin/activate
```

**Note**: To update the repository, you can run `git pull` from the `skyportal` directory. SkyPortal builds on top of `baselayer` where it is added as a submodule. Different SkyPortal branches might use different versions of baselayer. Always run the submodule update command after switching branches or pulling changes: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

*If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) be sure you clone the repository onto a location on the virtual machine, not the mounted Windows drive. Additionally, we recommend that you use WSL 2, and not WSL 1, in order to avoid complications in interfacing with the Linux image's `localhost` network.*

## Installation: MacOS

These instructions assume that you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed.

1. Install project dependencies

Using Homebrew, install core dependencies:
```
brew install supervisor nginx postgresql uv llvm libomp gsl rust
```
If you want to use [brotli compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli) with NGINX (better compression rates for the frontend), you can install NGINX with the `ngx_brotli` module with this command:
```
brew tap denji/nginx && brew install nginx-full --with-brotli
```

 _If you already had NGINX installed, you may need to uninstall it first with `brew unlink nginx`._ Otherwise, you can install NGINX normally with `brew install nginx`.

Finally, install these compression libraries. These are needed in order to install the Python dependency `tables` later on. After installation, Homebrew will display paths to each library. Be sure to save these paths, as theyâ€™ll be needed later to set environment variables.
```
brew install hdf5 c-blosc lzo bzip2
```
After installing each package, Homebrew will print out the installation paths. You should add these paths to your `.zshrc` file to ensure SkyPortal can locate these libraries. Instructions for this can be found in the [Configuring Shell Environment for Development](#configure-shell-mac) section below.

2. Start the PostgreSQL server:

  - To start it, run: `brew services start postgresql`
  - To stop it, run: `brew services stop postgresql`

  You may also need to run the following command to create the proper admin user:

  ```bash
  /opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@<version>/bin/createuser -s postgres
  ```
  where `<version>` is the version of PostgreSQL you are running.

3. To run the test suite, you'll need Geckodriver:

	```
	brew install geckodriver
	```

4. To build the docs, you'll need graphviz:

	```
	brew install graphviz
	```

<a name="configure-shell-mac"></a>
### Configuring Shell Environment for Development

When developing with SkyPortal on mac, you may  also need to configure your shell enviroment. Here is how you can do that by editing your `.zshrc` file.

#### Open your `.zshrc` file in a text editor:

```
nano ~/.zshrc
```
#### Set environment variables to their installation paths
After installing the libraries with Homebrew, you'll need to set environment variables to their installation paths. Replace the placeholder text `<path-to-library>/<version>` with the actual path that Homebrew provides upon successful installation.

```
export HDF5_DIR="<path-to-hdf5>/<version>"
export BLOSC_DIR="<path-to-c-blosc>/<version>"
export LZO_DIR="<path-to-lzo>/<version>"
export BZIP_DIR="<path-to-bzip2>/<version>"
```
You can also run `brew info <package_name>` to display the install path.

Typically, Homebrew provides these paths upon successful installation. You can also discover where a library was installed by Homebrew with this command:

```
brew info <name_of_package>
```

#### To activate the changes, source your .zshrc file:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```
### Checking for Port Availability
SkyPortal defaults to using port 5000. However, this port may already be in use by MacPorts or other services. To verify if port 5000 is available, use the `lsof` command in the terminal.

```
lsof -i :5000
```
If the command outputs information about a service, it means that port 5000 is already in use. In this case, you may need to configure SkyPortal to use a different port using instructions found in the [Port Configuration](#port-configuration) section.

## Installation: Debian-based Linux and WSL

1. Install dependencies

	```
	sudo apt install supervisor postgresql \
	libpq-dev python3-pip \
	libcurl4-gnutls-dev libgnutls28-dev
	```

	If you want to use [brotli compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli) with NGINX (better compression rates for the frontend), you have to install NGINX and the brotli module from another source with:

	```
	sudo apt remove -y nginx nginx-common nginx-core
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/nginx-mainline -y
	sudo apt update -y
	sudo apt install -y nginx libnginx-mod-brotli
	```

	Otherwise, you can install NGINX normally with `sudo apt-get install nginx`.

	Then, we install `Bun` (a javascript runtime, faster equivalent to `node+npm`):

	```
	curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
	```

	Finally, we install `uv` (a faster equivalent to `pip` and `virtualenv`):

	```
	curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
	```

2. Configure your database permissions.

	In `pg_hba.conf` (typically located in
	`/etc/postgresql/<postgres-version>/main`, or if using homebrew on macos: `/opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@<version>/pg_hba.conf` where version is the version of postgres you are running), insert the following lines
	*before* any other `host` lines:

	```
	host skyportal skyportal 127.0.0.1/32 trust
	host skyportal_test skyportal 127.0.0.1/32 trust
	host all postgres 127.0.0.1/32 trust
	```

	If you are deploying SkyPortal using IPv6 rather than IPv4, you should add the following lines instead:

	```
	host skyportal skyportal ::1/128 trust
	host skyportal_test skyportal ::1/128 trust
	host all postgres ::1/128 trust
	```

	In some PostgreSQL installations, the default TCP port may be different from the 5432 value assumed in our default configuration file values. To remedy this, you can either edit your config.yaml file to reflect your system's PostgreSQL default port, or update your system-wide config to use port 5432 by editing /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf (replace "14" with your installed version number) and changing the line `port = XXXX` (where "XXXX" is whatever the system default was) to `port = 5432`.

	Restart PostgreSQL:

	```
	sudo service postgresql restart
	```

3. To run the test suite, you'll need Geckodriver:

	- Download the latest version from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/
	- Extract the binary to somewhere on your path
	- Ensure it runs with `geckodriver --version`

	In later versions of Ubuntu (16.04+), you can install Geckodriver through apt:
	```
	sudo apt install firefox-geckodriver
	```

4. To build the docs, you'll need graphviz:

	```
	sudo apt install graphviz-dev graphviz
	```

## Launch

0. Make sure you are in the skyportal env by running `source skyportal_env/bin/activate`
1. Initialize the database with `make db_init` (this only needs to
   happen once, or anytime you run `make db_clear` to wipe the database, which is useful for development).
2. Copy `config.yaml.defaults` to `config.yaml`, and edit the configuration as you see fit.
3. Run `make run` to start the server, and then run `make log` in a separate window to monitor the different services.
4. Direct your browser to `http://localhost:5000`.
5. If you want some test data to play with, run `make load_demo_data` (do this while the server is running!).
6. Change users by navigating to `http://localhost:5000/become_user/<#>` where # is a number from 1-5.
   Different users have different privileges and can see more or less of the demo data.

<a id="port-configuration"></a>
## Port Configuration

Skyportal uses two distinct ports in its configuration:

1. Internal Port - Where the application is actually hosted
2. Public-Facing Port - Where external users access the application

If you need to use different ports (e.g., port 5000 is already in use):
1. Copy `config.yaml.defaults` to `config.yaml` if you haven't already
2. Add the following changes to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# ... other config settings ...

ports:
	app: 5001  # Choose an available port for internal hosting
	...

...

server:
	port: 5001  # Choose an available port for public access
	...

...
```

## Troubleshooting

If you have trouble getting the demo data try doing

```make db_clear && make db_init && make run```

and then, from a different window, do `make load_demo_data`.

If you are using WSL, be sure everything (the git repository and all dependencies) are on the Linux machine and not the Windows side, as connection oddities can otherwise cause several errors.

Mac users may need to disable Airplay Receiver in System Preferences to free up port 5000 and avoid a 403 Forbidden error.

## Additional Configuration

The configuration file lives in `config.yaml`, and is meant to be
self-documenting.  Please modify as you see fit.

**Before deploying this on a public server** change `app:secret-key`
to a unique value.

If you want to use a different configuration file, you may launch any
of the SkyPortal commands with the FLAGS environment variable set:

```
FLAGS="--config=myconfig.yaml" make run
```

### Authentication

By default, the server allows anyone to log in (even if it presents a
login screen).  If you are running a public-facing instance of
SkyPortal, you should enable multi-user login by adding Google
credentials to the `server:auth` section of the configuration file and
setting `debug_login` to `False`.

### Creating an administrative user

By default, no user has permission to perform system administration.
You can give this and other permissions to an existing user by running the following from your terminal in the `skyportal` directory:
```
PYTHONPATH=. python tools/set_user_role.py --username="<username>" --role="<role>"
```

The `role` argument is optional, and defaults to `Super admin`.

You may also list all users and their roles:
```
PYTHONPATH=. python tools/set_user_role.py --list
```


### Test data

By default, SkyPortal contains no data.  You can ingest some sample light curves by running

```
make load_demo_data
```

This also adds `testuser@cesium-ml.org` as an administrator.

### Deploying secure HTTP / SSL certificate

When running a public server, you will likely want to deploy an SSL certificate (i.e., serve `https://your.url` instead of `http://your.url`). Certificates can be obtained for free from services such as Let's Encrypt (https://letsencrypt.org/).

[certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is software for helping you obtain a new SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.
To do so, it first verifies that your server is running (without SSL) at the specified domain.

Start SkyPortal using `make run`.

Then, install `certbot`:
    uv pip install certbot-nginx

Ask `certbot` to verify the service and retrieve a new certificate:
    sudo certbot certonly --standalone --preferred-challenges http -d http://your.url
or similar if using https
    sudo certbot certonly --standalone --preferred-challenges https -d https://your.url

To renew and retrieve the certificate, do:
    sudo certbot renew

Next, modify the nginx configuration in `baselayer/services/nginx/nginx.conf.template` to use the newly generated certificate, placing it at the top of the server section:

    server {
      listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on;
      listen 443 ssl;
      ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/{YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE}/fullchain.pem;
      ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/{YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE}/privkey.pem;
      include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
      ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
      ...
   }

Finally, stop the app and run it again using `make run`.
