# MMA Features

We are beginning to add multi-messenger astronomy (MMA) features to the app. In particular, we are ingesting events from GCN; the service controlling this is here: https://github.com/skyportal/skyportal/blob/master/skyportal/services/gcn_service/gcn_service.py.

We are building out features on the **gcn_events** page, where information on the events (including the skymaps), and associated triggering of follow-up is being made available. In particular, **Allocations** now cover both transient follow-up (as a **FollowupRequest**) and GCN event follow-up (as an **ObservationPlanRequest**). These **ObservationPlanRequest**s in particular are triggered on the front-end from the **gcn_events** page, with drop down menus creating a schedule for a given instrument. This request creates an ObservationPlan, which will then have the option of being sent to the instrument through the APIs developed in the **FollowupRequest** (see the APIs here: https://github.com/skyportal/skyportal/tree/master/skyportal/facility_apis).
