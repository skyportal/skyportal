# Analyzing database queries

You may sometimes find yourself needing to either debug or optimize specific queries against the
PostgreSQL database made by the API handlers. This section outlines some tips for going about
analyzing and fixing these queries.

## SQLAlchemy

As described in the [Database Schema](database) section, SkyPortal communicates with the
PostgreSQL database via the [SQLAlchemy](http://sqlalchemy.org) ORM. More specifically, most
of this is done through the SQLAlchemy `Query` object API, found [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/query.html).
Database queries are built via the methods in this `Query` API, and compiled into SQL queries
to be sent to the underlying database - in our case PostgreSQL.

For example, a query written like this on the Python side

```python
DBSession().query(Instrument.id).filter(Instrument.id == 1)
```

would yield the following Postgres-dialect SQL query

```SQL
SELECT instruments.id FROM instruments WHERE instruments.id = 1;
```

A good first step to debugging or looking for inefficiencies in a query made by the SkyPortal backend
is to look at the actual SQL generated by SQLAlchemy for the query. To do so, you can do something like this:

```python
from sqlalchemy.dialects import postgresql
query = DBSession().query(Instrument.id).filter(Instrument.id == 1)
print(query.statement.compile(dialect=postgresql.dialect()))
```

Note the specification of the PostgreSQL dialect when printing the compiled SQL. This ensures that any
Postgres-specific conventions or syntax are respected in the conversion to SQL, as described in the
SQLAlchemy documentation [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/faq/sqlexpressions.html#stringifying-for-specific-databases).

For example, the following expression prints out two different versions when the equivalent SQL is asked for,
based on whether the PostgreSQL dialect is specified or not:

```python
from sqlalchemy.dialects import postgresql
from sqlalchemy import column
expression = column('x') == 'some value'
print(expression)
print(expression.compile(dialect=postgresql.dialect()))
```

Output:

```
x = :x_1
x = %(x_1)s
```

Finally, you should note that in the SkyPortal API handlers, most of the SQLAlchemy `Query` objects
that you would print out in this manner originate from our [permissions framework](permissions.html)
through the `query_accessible_rows()` method. Thus, if you're ever lost looking for those
`DBSession().query()...` lines to do this sort of print-debugging, you may want to look for the
`query_accessible_rows()` lines instead. Similarly, if you're ever wondering where certain parts of
the printed out SQL are coming from (especially a series of joins), the access control rules
defined in `skyportal/models.py` for the database model being queried can be a good place to start.

## PostgreSQL

Once you have the full SQL query, it can be easier to spot errors/inefficiencies and to experiment
with different approaches. It is easier, after all, to directly edit the SQL and try different ways
of joining, moving around subqueries, etc. without also trying to figure out how to get SQLAlchemy
to produce the exact queries you're envisioning.

Some quick tips with regards to debugging/optimizing raw SQL:

- Use a pretty-printer like [this one](https://www.dpriver.com/pp/sqlformat.htm) to get nicely
  indented versions of longer queries to more easily spot mistakes and understand what a query
  is doing.
- A missing index is often both the biggest bottleneck and the quickest fix to a slow query. You
  can easily check which columns are indexed on a given table by running `\d table_name` within
  [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-psql.html).
- Another common inefficiency in queries is a cross-join, where each row in a table is joined against
  every row in another table and is rarely what you really want. Cross-joins will show up in the SQL
  generated by SQLAlchemy with the `table_a , table_b` syntax. It can be hard to spot those commas,
  so be on the lookout for them.

### EXPLAIN ANALYZE

Finally, the most helpful (and in-depth) way of analyzing the performance of a SQL query is through
the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement. You can connect to the SkyPortal database using `psql` and then run
`EXPLAIN ANALYZE [your SQL query here]` in order to get a report of the steps PostgreSQL took to
carry out your query, and how long each step took. This can often point you toward the changes
necessary to speed up your query. For example, you may notice that PostgreSQL is looping through an
entire table (a `SEQ SCAN`) to look for certain rows instead of using an index. More detailed guidance
on using the `EXPLAIN` outputs can be found in [the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/using-explain.html).
