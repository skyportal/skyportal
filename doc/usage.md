# Usage
## Permissions
Access to resources in Skyportal is controlled in two ways:
- *Roles* are sets of site-wide permissions (*ACLs*) that allow a user to perform certain actions: e.g, create a new user, upload spectra, post comments, etc.
- *Groups* are sets of sources that are accessible to members of that group
    - Members can also be made an *admin* of the group, which gives them group-specific permissions to add new users, etc.
    - The same source source can belong to multiple groups
## Adding roles to users
- User permissions can be managed on the `/users/` page  # TODO not fully implemented
## Adding users to groups
- Groups membership can be managed on the `/groups/` page  # TODO not fully implemented
## Connecting streams and groups
- Not yet implemented
