# Styling components

SkyPortal is built on top of [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/)
(MUI).  We have evaluated several styling systems, including inline
styles, CSS Modules, and Styled Components, and have settled on using
[MUI's style hooks API](https://mui.com/system/styles/basics/#hook-api).

```js
import makeStyles from "@mui/styles/makeStyles";
```

MUI provides `makeStyles`, which takes in JSS (JavaScript Style
Sheets) and returns a CSS provider [hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html):

```js
const useStyles = makeStyles({
  root: {
    border: 0,
    padding: '1rem',
  },
});
```

The resulting `useStyles` can then be used inside of a component:

```jsx
import Typography from "@mui/material/Typography";

const Text = () => {
  const classes = useStyles();
  return <Typography className={classes.root}>Text</Typography>;
}
```

It is possible to make nested definitions:

```js
const useStyles = makeStyles({
  root: {
    color: 'red',
    '& p': {
      color: 'green',
      '& span': {
        color: 'blue'
      }
    }
  },
});
```

This is done via the
[`&` selector](http://lesscss.org/features/#parent-selectors-feature):
`&p` is a `p` element on `root` here.

You can also [parameterize `makeStyles`](https://mui.com/system/styles/basics/#adapting-based-on-props).

## Components

Please refer to the [MUI component
docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/) for available
components and their props and CSS styles.

## Buttons
Do not use the MUI Button component, instead use SkyPortal's standardized Button component. Import as such (assuming you are editing a component in the `static/js/components` directory):

```js
import Button from './Button';
```

### Usage

There are three accepted button types: primary, secondary, and a regular text button. Use primary buttons for actions such as saving information to the DB or submitting a form. Use secondary buttons and the regular/default button for other actions.

![buttons](images/buttons.png)

Instead of passing `variant` and `color` props, pass in boolean props describing which button you want.

```jsx
// Primary button
<Button primary>
  Button text
</Button>

// Secondary button
<Button secondary>
  Button text
</Button>

// Regular/default button- no prop
<Button>
  Button text
</Button>
```

SkyPortal's Button component accepts all the [same props as regular MUI Buttons](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/button/#props).

```jsx
// Add an onClick handler
<Button
  primary
  onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}
>
  Click me!
</Button>

// Small secondary button
<Button
  secondary
  size="small"
>
  I'm small
</Button>
```

### Icons
Use the `endIcon` prop for adding icons to buttons. (Do not use the `startIcon` prop.)

```jsx
import SearchIcon from "@mui/icons-material/Search";
// ...
<Button
  primary
  endIcon={<SearchIcon />}>
>
  Search
</Button>
```

### Asynchronous Operations
Use the `async` and `loading` props to make buttons disabled while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete. Async buttons will always have primary button styling.

![async button](images/async_button.gif)
```jsx
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
const waitForAsyncOperation = () => {
  setLoading(true)
  // async operation here...
  setLoading(false)
}
<Button
  async
  loading={loading}
  onClick={waitForAsyncOperation}
>
  Async button
</Button>
```

## Sizes

All sizes should be specified using `rem`, which stands for "root
element"â€”i.e., `1.5rem` would be 1.5 times the size of the font-size
specified in the root HTML element.

## Style props on Box

`makeStyles` is preferred in general, but for simple formatting you
may use [style
props](https://mui.com/system/basics/#all-inclusive) on `Box`
containers:

```
<Box m={2rem} />
```

See also "Grid system" below.

## Responsive Design

MUI uses
[breakpoints](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/breakpoints/)
as a convenient way of writing CSS media queries.

Breakpoints understand the following pre-defined screen sizes:

- `xs` (extra-small): 0px or larger
- `sm` (small): 600px or larger
- `md` (medium): 960px or larger
- `lg` (large): 1280px or larger
- `xl` (extra-large): 1920px or larger

While MUI supports several breakpoint operators (`up`, `down`, `only`,
and `between`), because of confusing logic we only use `up`:

- `theme.breakpoints.up(sm)`: targets screen sizes `>= small`

Use it as follows:

```js
const useStyles = makeStyles({
  root: {
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
    [theme.breakpoints.up('md')]: {
      backgroundColor: 'red',
    },
  }
});
```

You may customize media-queries using the
[`useMediaQuery`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-use-media-query/)
hook.

### Grid system

For positioning components on a page, MUI provides a [12-column grid
layout](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid/).

There are two `Grid` types: `container` (outer element) and `item`
(inner elements).

```jsx
<Grid container spacing={1rem}>
  <Grid item xs={4}>
    <Paper>Cell 1</Paper>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={4}>
    <Paper>Cell 2</Paper>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={4}>
    <Paper>Cell 3</Paper>
</Grid>
```

The `xs` above refers to `xs`, the breakpoint from the previous
section.  In other words, this split of cells will be used from `xs`
and up.
[Multiple breakpoints](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid/#grid-with-breakpoints)
can be specified.

You can also leave the value of `xs` blank, in which case elements are automatically spaced:

```jsx
<Grid container spacing={1rem}>
  <Grid item xs>
    <Paper>Cell 1</Paper>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={6}>
    <Paper>Cell 2</Paper>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs>
    <Paper>Cell 3</Paper>
</Grid>
```

## Do's and don'ts

- Do not use inline styles

  When a list of components are rendered with inline styles, you cannot
  easily use the web developer tools to modify all of their CSS at the
  same time (editing one will edit just one instance, instead of all).

  Inline styles are spread all over the place, so it is harder to
  hunt down.

  Inline CSS also does not support media queries for responsive design.
