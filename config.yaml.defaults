  # See https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout for more on the grid package
  homepage_grid:
    # This section describes the grid on which Home Page widgets are laid out.
    #
    # The breakpoints describe screen sizes at which a different set of widget
    # layouts should be used. Note that these breakpoints describe minimum width
    # values, unlike the maximum width bounds used by Material UI breakpoints.
    # For example, a breakpoint of "sm: 650" will match windows with width 650px
    # or greater, until the next highest breakpoint is hit (probably a "md").
    # This is different from Material UI, where a breakpoint of 650 would match
    # window widths that are at most 650px.
    #
    # The cols describe the number of evenly spaced columns that make up the
    # grid at a given breakpoint. For example, on extra-large screens (greater
    # than ${breakpoints.xlg} pixels), the grid will use ${cols.xlg} columns of
    # equal width to describe sizes of widgets based on the layouts provided.
    #
    # Optionally, you may provide a "row_height: {a rem value}" property in
    # this section to change the height of a row on the grid. By default, this
    # value is 9.375rem (150px for the default 16px = 1rem configuration).

    breakpoints:
      xlg: 1400
      lg: 1150
      md: 996
      sm: 650
      xs: 0

    cols:
      xlg: 16
      lg: 12
      md: 10
      sm: 6
      xs: 4

  homepage_widgets:
    # This section describes the specific widgets shown on the Home Page and how
    # they are laid out by default on the grid of the page.
    #
    # The name of section should be the same as the widget's React component.
    #
    # The props property should be a set of properties to be passed on to the
    # underlying React component for the widget. You may run into cases in which
    # you must pass a more complex, dynamic property (perhaps fetched from the
    # application redux store). Since you can not know that in the time of the
    # configuration writing, such properties should be directly coded into the
    # HomePage.jsx.template file (see the GroupList widget for an example)
    #
    # By default, any widget listed here is shown on the Home Page. However, you
    # can give a widget the property "show: false" to turn off rendering of the
    # widget.
    #
    # The resizable property determines whether the user is able to resize the
    # widget after it has been rendered based on default layouts.
    #
    # Finally, the layouts property provides an array of default sizes/locations
    # for each screen width breakpoint for the given widget. Layout arrays are
    # given in the order [x, y, width, height], in units of grid columns/rows.
    # For example, a layout array of [1, 2, 3, 4] will render a widget 3 grid
    # columns in width, 4 grid rows in height, and have its upper-left corner at
    # the column 1 (zero-indexed) and row 2. Note that each row is by default
    # 150px in height. The row height can be altered in the homepage_grid
    # section above (as well as other grid characteristics).
